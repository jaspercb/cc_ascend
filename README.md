samsara
================

What is it?
----------------

Samsara is a zero-setup semi-automated ascension script for [Kingdom of Loathing](http://kingdomofloathing.com).
To use, you need to be using [KoLmafia, a third-party tool](http://kolmafia.sourceforge.net).

Samsara is a fork of the excellent cheesecookie's inactive [cc\_ascend script](http://alliancefromhell.com/viewtopic.php?t=6363), which is itself a fork of the excellent bumcheekcity's inactive [bumcheekascend script](https://kolmafia.us/showthread.php?4963-bumcheekcend.ash-A-zero-setup-semi-automated-ascension-script).

How do I use it?
----------------
First, install it by running this command in KoLmafia's graphical CLI:

`svn checkout https://github.com/jaspercb/samsara/trunk/Release/`

Once it's installed, look in the relay browser. In the upper-right, there will
be a "-run script-" menu.

Select `cc_ascend.ash`.

To update the script itself, run this command in the graphical CLI:

`svn update`
